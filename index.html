    <p>Animal Agriculture has been happening since humans learned to monitor animals for food in 13,000 BC. As technology advances, meat production yield drastically increases. Unfortunately, there are many disadvantages. The toxins and antibiotics that get inside the animals get eaten by humans, harming our health. Over time, it can lead to cancer, respiratory problems, or more. Overgrazing is another consequence that causes soil erosion and land deforestation. The amount of water and land resources are limited. However, since the farmers use an abundant amount of water and land the methods they use to manage are brutal. They have hundreds of animals together in a compact space. So, the animals end up pooping and peeing on top of each other. The feces contribute to a positive feedback loop of pollution. The pollution from animal waste consists of lots of methane. Not only does it involve pollution, but also many diseases are easily contracted. This explains why the initial infections of COVID-19 were from an animal marketplace. The living conditions for the animals are crazy. According to the World Animal Foundation, "animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, habitat destruction and ocean dead zones. Animal agribusiness already occupies about 40% of Earthâ€™s landmass and accounts for 75% of global deforestation. The rapid destruction is causing species to disappear, negatively impacting the biodiversity of native ecosystems and furthering our path into the 6th mass extinction of all species on Earth." Animal agriculture would be considered inhumane if we treated humans the same way, so why does the exploitation of animals get discussed by society as a norm. It think it is because there isn't enough awareness of the cruelty happening, which is why I am writing this blog. I want to raise awareness, educate, and inspire others on the issue of animal agriculture. Ever since I was 10 years old, my parents made me acknowledge the cruelty of animal agriculture. So, in fourth grade, I became committed to being a vegetarian. Soon, I slowly stopped eating dairy and became vegan. The most effective solution to the issue is to stop buying into it and start either being vegan, vegetarian, or buying organic, grass-fed animal meat. If you scroll down more, I have provided healthier alternatives for ingredients that are more beneficial to the environment and human health.</p>
